## Introduction

This project combines the power of Cypress for end-to-end testing with Cucumber for writing tests in a human-readable format. The goal is to provide a clear example of how to structure and execute tests using this powerful combination.

## Getting Started

To get started with this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the necessary dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Run the Cypress Cucumber tests using `npm test`.

## Features

Explore the features and capabilities demonstrated in this example project:

- **Cucumber Integration:** Demonstrates writing feature files in Gherkin syntax and executing them with Cypress.
- **Step Definitions:** Examples of defining step definitions to link feature files with Cypress commands.
- **Page Objects:** Illustrates the use of Page Objects to organize and manage Cypress commands for better maintainability.
- **Scenario Outlines:** Shows how to use Scenario Outlines for data-driven testing with Cucumber.

## Folder Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- `cypress/`: Contains the Cypress test files.
  - `e2e/`: Holds feature files and step definitions.
  - `support/`: Includes additional support files and utilities.
  - `fixtures/`: Stores test data and sample payloads.

## VSCode Configuration

For seamless integration with VSCode, consider adding the following configuration to your `settings.json` file:

```json
"cucumberautocomplete.steps": [
    "cypress/e2e/cucumber-tests/step_definitions/*.js",
],
"cucumberautocomplete.syncfeatures": "cypress/e2e/cucumber-tests/features/*feature",

## Usage

To run the Cypress Cucumber tests, use the following command:

```bash
npm test
